Installation:
Install Python 3.7+ and run "pip install PyPDF2"
Usage:
In the code, edit "pdf_path" to point to your PDF file. Run "python your_script.py" to extract text and find keyword matches.
Parameters:
The "PARAMETERS" dictionary defines categories (e.g., "Study Design") and their related keywords. Modify them as needed to suit different research contexts.
Results:
The script prints each category’s matching lines or “No mention found.” for unmatched categories.
Notes:
Some PDFs may require advanced parsing. Keyword searching can lead to irrelevant matches if terms appear in different contexts.
